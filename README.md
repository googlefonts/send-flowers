# Send Flowers

Send Flowers is a mono-weight script font with clean connecting strokes and a highly legible style. It has a cute look, but since it is a cursive it has a bit more sophistication that is appropriate for an older audience. It's old school juvenile, with a delicate appeal.

## Building the Fonts

The font is built using fontmake and gftools post processing script. Tools are all python based, so it must be previously installed.

To install all the Python tools into a virtualenv, do the following:

From terminal:

```

cd your/local/project/directory

#once in the project folder create a virtual environment. 
This step has to be done just once, the first time:

python3 -m venv venv

#activate the virtual environment

source venv/bin/activate

#install the required dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Then run the this command:

```
cd sources
gftools builder config.yml
```
